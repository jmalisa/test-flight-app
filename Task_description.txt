Task Description

Functionality
Develop a multi-page application consisting of two pages:
First page – 
Flight list with filtering and sorting options:
To retrieve the flight list, send a GET request to test_flights.json
Filters should be dynamically generated based on available criteria from the flight list
Ability to sort by key parameters (price, departure time, etc.)
The page should display the first 5 flights, and the Show more button should display the next 5, and so on
Airline logos are available in public assets
Second page – 
Traveler information form:
The form must include required input fields
Instead of sending a real POST request when the form is submitted, display the traveler form data and flight ID in an alert or console log
Key requirement – if the user fills out the form, clicks the "Back" button, and selects any flight, the previously entered data should remain in the form.

Include a Readme.md file with instructions for running the project
